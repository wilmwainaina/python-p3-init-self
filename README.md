# Object Initialization

## Learning Goals

- Learn about the `__init__` method.
- Learn about the `self` keyword.
- Initialize unique objects from the same class.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Class**: a bundle of data and functionality. Can be copied and modified to
accomplish a wide variety of programming tasks.
- **Initialize**: create a working copy of a class using its `__init__()`
method.
- **Instance**: one specific working copy of a class. It is created when a
class's `__init__()` method is called.
- **Object**: the more common name for an instance. The two can usually be used
interchangeably.
- **Function**: a series of steps that create, transform, and move data.
- **Method**: a function that is defined inside of a class.
- **self**: a keyword reference to the current instance of the class that is
used to access attributes of the instance.
- **Attribute**: variables that belong to an object.

## Introduction

We've already seen many new instances of different classes being created:

```py
class Dog:
    pass

fido = Dog()
# <__main__.Dog object at 0x104fc0550>

snoopy = Dog()
# <__main__.Dog object at 0x104fc0562>
```

We know from their IDs that `fido` and `snoopy` live in different locations
in memory, but their _behavior_ is identical. We don't provide them any unique
methods or attributes in the code above.

We can modify their attributes using dot notation as follows:

```py
fido.breed = "Dalmatian"
snoopy.breed = "Beagle"

fido.breed
# Dalmatian
snoopy.breed
# Beagle
```

...but dogs are _born_ with breeds, not assigned breeds later on. To provide
objects with unique attributes upon instantiation, we use the `__init__`
method.

***

## `__init__`

Every time we initialize a new object, the Python interpreter calls a **magic
method** called `__init__`. **Magic methods** (also called **dunder methods**
due to their **double** **underscores**) are special methods that are not meant
to be called by developers but are invoked by different cues and operators that
act on their objects.

The `__init__` method belongs to every class and is invoked when you
initialize a class. Though you cannot see it in our `Dog` class above, there
is code that is executed behind the scenes.

Though it always executes when we initialize an object, it does not do anything
by default. Instead, we overwrite `__init__` in most classes to change an
object's behavior:

```py
class Dog:
    # Remember that all methods use "self." We'll elaborate on this in a moment.
    def __init__(self):
        print("A dog is born!")

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")
    
fido = Dog()
# A dog is born!
```

`__init__` can also be modified to take more arguments. This allows us to
customize the behavior of unique objects:

```py
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        print(f"{name} is born!")

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

fido = Dog("Fido")
# Fido is born!

snoopy = Dog("Snoopy")
# Snoopy is born!
```

***

## `self`

Modifying `__init__` has allowed us to provide `fido` and `snoopy` with
different behaviors, but now that they've both been initialized, they're more
or less the same dog. In order to make lasting changes to an object, we need
to modify `self`. Before we do, open up the Python shell and let's take a look
at `self`:

```py
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        print(f"{name} is born!")

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

    def showing_self(self):
        return self

fido = Dog("Fido")
# Fido is born!
fido.showing_self()
# <__main__.Dog object at 0x104f8bfa0>
```

You might recognize this output from earlier- `self` is the same type of object
as `fido`! As a matter of fact, it _is_ `fido`!

```py
fido is fido.showing_self()
# True
```

How does this work? Inside the `showing_self()` method, we use the `self`
keyword.

The `self` keyword **refers to the instance**, or object, that the
`showing_self()` **method is being called on**.

So, when we call `showing_self()` on `fido`, the method will return the `Dog`
instance that is `fido`.

If youâ€™re familiar with Object Oriented JavaScript from previous experience, the
closest equivalent to `self` in Python is `this` in JavaScript. Again, no
worries if you haven't seen OOJS before. The `this` keyword behaves similarly,
where `this` refers to **the object to the left of the dot** when a method is
called on an object:

```js
class Dog {
  showingThis() {
    return this;
  }
}

const fido = new Dog();
fido.showingThis();
// => Dog {}
```

***

## `__init__` and `self` Together

Now that we know that `__init__` contains code that runs whenever we initialize
a new object and that the `self` that is passed to each method is a reference
to the initialized object, let's make some unique dogs:

```py
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

fido = Dog("Fido")
fido.name
# Fido

snoopy = Dog("Snoopy")
snoopy.name
# Snoopy
```

***

## Operating on `self` in an Instance Method

Let's say that Fido here is getting adopted. Fido's new owner is Sophie.
We can set Fido's `owner` attribute equal to the string of `"Sophie"`. The
name of his new owner:

```py
class Dog:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

fido.owner = "Sophie"

fido.owner
# "Sophie"
```

Great, Fido now knows the name of his owner. Let's think about the situation in
which `fido` gets a new owner. This would occur at the moment in which `fido` is
adopted.

To represent this with code, we could write an `adopt()` function like this:

```py
def adopt(dog, owner_name):
    dog.owner = owner_name
```

Here we have a method that takes in two arguments, an instance of the `Dog`
class and an owner's name. We could call our method like this:

```py
adopt(fido, "Sophie")

# now we can ask Fido who his owner is:

fido.owner
# => "Sophie"
```

However, the beauty of object-oriented programming is that we can encapsulate,
or wrap up, attributes and behaviors into one object. Instead of writing a
function that is not associated to any particular object and that takes in
certain objects as arguments, we can simply teach our `Dog` instances how to get
adopted.

Let's refactor our code above into an instance method on the `Dog` class.

```py
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

    def get_adopted(self, owner_name):
        self.owner = owner_name
```

Here, we use the `self` keyword inside of the `get_adopted()` instance method
to refer to whichever dog this method is being called on. We set that dog's
owner equal to `owner_name` just as we would assign any other variable!

Think about it: if `self` **refers to the object on which the method is being
called**, and if that object is an instance of the `Dog` class, then we can call
any of our other instance methods on `self`.

Here's how we'd use the `get_adopted()` method:

```py
fido = Dog("Fido")
fido.get_adopted("Sophie")
fido.owner
# "Sophie"
```

***

## Optional `__init__` Arguments

There are a number of things that are important to know about a dog that you're
planning to adopt. Age, weight, breed, and many more attributes factor into
whether they're a good fit for you and your home. Other things, like favorite
toys, are not quite so important.

To accommodate these less important details, Python lets us set default values
for arguments in any method or function. Let's see how we would prepare an
optional `favorite_toy` argument:

```py
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, favorite_toy="Any"):
        self.name = name
        self.favorite_toy = favorite_toy

fido = Dog("Fido")
fido.favorite_toy
# Any

snoopy = Dog("Snoopy", "Tennis Ball")
snoopy.favorite_toy
# Tennis Ball
```

Do note, however, that arguments without default values are _not_ optional:

```py
old_yeller = Dog()
# TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'name'
```

<details><summary><em>Can functions have optional arguments too?</em></summary>
<p>

<h3>Yes!</h3>
<p>Aside from the <code>self</code> keyword, functions and methods are
identical.</p>
<p>One of the most common Python functions, <code>print()</code>, has an
optional <code>end</code> argument.</p>
</details>

## Instructions

Fork and clone the lab and run the tests with `pytest -x`.

### 1. `Dog.__init__` with Name and Breed defaulting to "Mutt"

Define a `Dog` class in `lib/dog.py`. In the class, define an `__init__`
method that accepts an argument for the dog's name. That argument should be
stored within a `self.name` attribute.

Additionally, `Dog.__init__` should accept a second _optional_ argument for
the dog's breed stored in an attribute `self.breed`. When no breed is provided,
it should default to "Mutt".

### 2. `Person.__init__` with a Name

Define a `Person` class in `lib/person.py`. In the class, define an
`__init__` method that accepts an argument for the person's name. That
argument should be stored within a `self.name` attribute.

***

## Conclusion

In Python, when we use `self` keyword in an **instance method**, `self` refers
to whatever instance that method was called on. It's like a special variable
that changes meaning depending on the context. Using `self` in conjunction with
`__init__` allows us to create objects and set their most important attributes
in one line of code. This also ensures that any objects of one class always
contain the data that they need to be useful later on.

This concept of our objects being self-aware is key to our ability to write
object-oriented code. It may take some time to familiarize yourself with this
concept, and that's ok! Just make sure to test out your code, and find ways to
determine what `self` is (like using `ipdb.set_trace()`) if you're ever not
sure.
